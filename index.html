        Sapporo, Japan. I don't think I have ever fallen in love with a city view so
        quickly. Upon first glance (when landing) it seems like any Japanese city.
        Lots of shops, many places to eat interesting food, and everyone driving
        on the left.<br><br>

        However...<br><br>

        Once you get to the top of the tower at the JR station, you see one of
        the most magnificent views imaginable. A prestine city covered in thawing
        snow in front of a mountain range that I could have just looked at for
        hours.<br><br>

        Aside from the wonderful view, Tower 38 (the name of the building of the JR
        tower) has a wonderful coffee shop on the top level so you can enjoy a nice
        mocha whatever as you bathe your eyes in a scenic landscape of human
        production. One quirky feature is the interesting bathroom on the 38th floor.
        Unfortunately, you have to be male, but on the top floor, you have a urinal
        with a spectacular view of the city once again. It's a bit odd considering that
        the feeling of using the restroom is a bit like peeing off the building itself.
        quite surreal considering that's probably what a lot of guys think of when they
        go to a tall building (I know I'm one of them). If city views arent your thing then I would suggest the wide
        array of artisian restuarants, tea houses, coffee and cake shops around the
        city.<br><br>

        During the two days that I was in Sapporo and Jozenkei (the mountain town
        nearby) there was a whole array of shops, restuarants, tea shops and cafes
        that all have their own style and flavor. From contemporary to modern, a wide
        selection of shops is there, and hopefully you have a diet plan on standby.
